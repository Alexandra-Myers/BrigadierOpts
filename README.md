# What?

BrigadierOpts is a successor to MCOpts, but varies widely in scope and usage. Brigadier did make producing and using commands much easier, but the implementations of it can be kind of clunky and rather rigid, so this mod is meant to alleviate that by making highly customizable but easy to use ways to interact with Brigadier.

# Usage

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Alexandra-Myers/BrigadierOpts/wiki) for how to use the mod as a developer.
